## Two-Compartment Model for Water Transport in Banana Crops

As part of my coursework on modeling continuous changes through **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**, I worked on a team project to develop a **two-compartment model** simulating water transport between soil and plants, with a focus on **banana crops**.

The project assessed fundamental processes such as **water absorption, transpiration, and evaporation** in the context of water management under various conditions. Using theoretically derived frameworks and real-world field data, we developed and tested differential equations to represent water dynamics, incorporating key factors like **soil permeability, evaporation rates, and root zone depth**.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Contributions  

#### ðŸ“Œ Model Design and Validation  
- Developed and validated a **mathematical model** capable of simulating **water flux** between soil and plant compartments over long periods.  

#### ðŸ“Œ Simulations and Scenario Analysis  
- Performed simulations under diverse scenarios, including **drought and saturated soil conditions**, to evaluate model adaptability and accuracy.  
- Utilized **parametric runs** with meteorological and agricultural data to ensure practical applicability for **crop irrigation** and **efficient water use**.  

#### ðŸ“Œ Proposals for Scaling  
- Proposed future enhancements to upscale the model for real-life **agricultural systems**, emphasizing **irrigation optimization** and **resource sustainability**.  

This project not only strengthened my skills in **ODE-based modeling and simulation** but also provided valuable insights into the intersection of **mathematics, agriculture, and sustainability**.
